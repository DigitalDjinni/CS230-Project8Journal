Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
	
	The Gaming Room client wanted to transform their Android game, into a game that could be played on other devices as well to broaden their audience and allow non-android users a chance to play this game. They wanted an application that had cross-platform capabilities as well as a unique naming system for multiplayer support and to avoid team conflicts.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

	Overall I feel I did very well developing these documents and my UML for this project. Part 1 of this project was by far the easiest for me as I found coming up with design constraints, and domain models way easier than the recommendation section.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

	The part I felt helpful was that it gave you something to look at when trying to piece everything together and figure out how it all worked. With a design document like this it makes the task a lot easier for developers to know whats really needed in the application and saves time meaning it would be faster to market with lower developer cost, both leading to a happy client.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

	If I could change one part of this project, I would change the recommendations section. I just feel that there is so much information I added here and while useful the client wouldn’t need to know all of this as some of it is technical jargon that would go over their head. I feel simplifying it a bit more with less tech talk would make it easier for a customer to fully grasp and understand.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

	I was able to interpret my users needs by listening to what they wanted in their application and develop based on their overall needs. This was important because this made things simple to understand for both the development team as well as the client and gave the client a finished product they could be happy with.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

	I approached designing this software by first having a transparent open line of communication between my developers and the client. This line of communication allows for the developers to understand the constraints they are working with as well as well as helping the client to understand how their program will be setup and function. Overall taking an approach with open communication puts everyone on the same page which will save development time and money and leaves the client happy with their finished product.
